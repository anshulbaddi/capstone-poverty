        <li>780 million people, 11 percent of the world's population, live in extreme poverty on less than $1.90 per

        <li>At least 17 million children suffer from severe acute malnutrition around the world. Severe acute

        where is extreme poverty?

        Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty. See below for a
        breakdown of where people living with less than $1.90 per day are located.
        413.3 million in Sub-Saharan Africa
        216.4 million in South Asia
        47.2 million in East Asia and Pacific
        25.9 million in Latin America and the Caribbean
        18.6 million in the Middle East and North Africa
        7.1 million in Europe and Central Asia</p>

    <p class="pstat">
        what about children in poverty?
        It is estimated that 104 million children under 5 are living in extreme poverty, while that number extends to
        328 million for children under 18 (World Bank, 2016).

        Children suffer the most when living in poverty. Their young, developing bodies are less resilient to the
        effects of living without clean water, food or health care. As a result, many children living in poverty suffer
        from malnutrition and disease. If left untreated—which is common due to limited access to health care—they
        cannot survive. It is estimated that only 10% of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition receive
        treatment.

        Watch the story of 13-year-old Keynyang, a brave young boy trying to support his family after conflict forced
        them to flee their home in South Sudan. With no money or food, his family is trying to survive by eating leaves.


        Keynyang's story demonstrates that extreme poverty is often the result of external factors that are far beyond
        the family's control. However, with the right support, there is hope. We have 40 years of experience of saving
        lives and supporting self-sufficiency for some of the world's most vulnerable populations. We are able to help
        communities become more resilient to external factors that cause extreme poverty, and help families recover from
        natural disasters or forced displacement.
